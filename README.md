# algos

## Description

This repository contains C++ code for various algorithms. The algorithms implemented here are mainly from computer science and mathematics. These algorithms have been implemented in C++ for educational purposes.

## Algorithms included

- **Sorting algorithms:** bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heapsort.
- **Graph algorithms:** Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm, Kruskal's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm.
- **Dynamic Programming algorithms:** Longest Common Subsequence (LCS), Knapsack Problem, Matrix Chain Multiplication, Edit Distance.

## Usage

To use these algorithms, simply clone the repository and compile the C++ files using a C++ compiler. Each algorithm is implemented in its own file, making it easy to find and use the specific algorithm you need.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have implemented an algorithm in C++ that is not currently included in this repository, feel free to submit a pull request.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/patriicke/algos.git
